\subsection{Design decisions}
\emph{Our interpretation of the task.} There are doctors and users. The doctors are able to mint Vaccination Slot tokens. The doctors are able to burn \emph{(invalidate)} a token when it's used up. The three most important property of a single token are: Type \emph{(of the vaccine)}, Date \emph{(when the token should be burned)}, Burned \emph{(is it used up)}.

A user can hold only one non-burned token and unlimited number of burned, if those were invalidated while the user was the owner - so the owner used that up. A user cannot trade a burned token.


\subsection{Data model}
TokenId is generated as a Universal Unique Identifier. Type is actually an \emph{enum} and it can be any of the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Alpha
  \item Bravo
  \item Charlie
  \item Delta
  \item Echo
\end{itemize}

  \begin{table}[h!]

    \begin{tabular}{|c | c | c |}
      \hline
      \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{Token}                      \\
      \hline
      name     & type      & comment                   \\
      \hline
      TokenId  & string    & generated id of the token \\
      Type     & string    & vaccine type              \\
      Date     & time.Time & vaccination date          \\
      Owner    & string    & owner of the token        \\
      Burned   & boolean   & is it used up             \\
      Approved & string    &                           \\
      \hline
    \end{tabular}
